Running was one of my favorite parts of this past year, and I cannot wait to see what runs, workouts, races, challenges, and PRs 2017 brings! Here are some quick stats from my 2016 running:</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2016 SEASONS</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Winter &amp; Spring Training abroad in Barcelona, Spain (2/13/16 - 2/23/16, 3/28/16 - 4/22/16) &amp; 3 races: Maratest Badalona 15K, 38th La Cursa El Corte Inglés 11K, Salomon 10K.</div><div><br></div><div>Summer Training at home in San Jose, California (5/31/16 - 8/20/16)</div><div><br></div><div>Cross Country Season with University of Redlands Cross Country (8/21/16 - 11/12/16) - 1 6K race, 5 8K races</div><div><br></div><div>Thanksgiving Break Training &amp; Silicon Valley Turkey Trot 5K Race - 11/19/16 - 11/24/16</div><div><br></div><div>Track Preseason with University of Redlands Track &amp; Field (11/28/16 - 12/11/16)</div><div><br></div><div>Winter Break Training (12/12/16 - 12/31/16)</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2016 TOTALS</strong></div><div><br></div><div>8,886 minutes OR 148 hours &amp; 6 minutes of running in 2016</div><div><br></div><div>3,494 minutes OR 58.28 hours of running in 2016 XC Season</div><div><br></div><div>About 1,550 miles ran in 2016 (Containing some running while abroad, 2016 XC Season, 2016 Track Preseason, &amp; Winter break training)</div><div><br></div><div>835.25 miles ran @ 7:19 average pace with my TomTom GPS Runner watch from July 25, 2016 - December 31st, 2016 (except from Nov. 25-Dec. 13 when I got it replaced)</div><div><br></div><div>I have been recording all of my runs, workouts, and races in my training book since the beginning of college running. I began to be very diligent about it beginning at the end of my Sophomore Year, &amp; began recording daily runs at the beginning of my Junior XC season, and I have been doing that since. I love recording runs &amp; workouts, it is cool to see progress and previous runs from months &amp; years past!</div><div><br></div><div>Today I ran my longest run since October 22nd, 2016 to kick off 2017! Today’s assigned run in my training plan was a long run at recovery pace (which is 7:41 average mile pace). I ran 1:15:17 (75 minutes, 17 seconds) at 7:21 average pace. I ran 10.25 miles, burned 911 calories, ran 511 feet in elevation ascent, &amp; my stride rate was 171 strides per minute.</div><div><br></div><div>My assigned runs are usually distance or recovery pace runs. My distance pace is 6:41 pace, &amp; my recovery pace is 7:43 pace.</div><div><br></div><div>Happy 2017! Don’t forget to exercise and enjoy it! Be focused, be diligent, work hard, and crave success.

Running was one of my favorite parts of this past year again as always, and I cannot wait to see what runs, workouts, races, challenges, and PRs 2018 brings! As a runner, I accomplished runs, workouts, &amp; races I never thought would be possible for me. Here are some statistics &amp; accomplishments from my 2017 running….</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2017 FINAL SEASON</strong></div><div>Final Track &amp; Field Season (Season 11) with University of Redlands Track &amp; Field (1/8/17 - 5/1/17)</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2017 TOTALS</strong></div><div><br></div><div>About 2,101.4 miles ran in 2017</div><div><br></div><div>Running Equipment: TomTom GPS Runner watch &amp; my TomTom Spark 3 GPS running watch. Thank you to TomTom, Adidas, Nike, New Balance, &amp; Saucony for the great gear &amp; support while running this year!</div><div><br></div><div>I have been recording all of my runs, workouts, and races in my training book since the beginning of college running. Transitioned to recording online in the SET On Running Google Document for post-collegiate running.</div><div><br></div><div>Post collegiate running and training began for me in July after 2+ months off from running after college track ended. Arizona running was tough when I moved this summer in June as temperatures were usually 100-119 degrees. I did a lot of treadmill runs in the summer until the end of August and I created a personal Distance circuit which I love doing during lifting days. My Distance Pace &amp; Recovery Pace have both dropped since I began getting back to high mileage since August and I have ran some recovery run &amp; distance run PRs since then.</div><div><br></div><div>In 2017, I ran 13 races, including 8 races during my last Track season. I ran 7 Lifetime PRs, including in the following race distances:</div><div><br></div><div><strong><em>400 Meters</em></strong> - 51.40</div><div><strong><em>800 Meters</em></strong> - 1:59.58</div><div><strong><em>1,500 Meters</em></strong> - 4:10.09</div><div><strong><em>4 Miles (6.43K)</em></strong> - 24:40</div><div><strong><em>15,000 Meters (15K or 9.32 Miles)</em></strong> - 56:46&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Half Marathon (13.10 Miles)</strong> - 1:21:11</div><div><strong><em>Long Run</em></strong> - 18.03 Miles @ 6:25 Pace - 1:55:58</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2017 Post Collegiate Races:</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Global Energy Run 5K</strong> - 17:48 &amp; 2nd place overall out of 458 runners &amp; 2nd place in age group</div><div><strong>Veterans Day Run 5K</strong> - 17:21 &amp; 1st place overall out of 327 runners &amp; 1st place in age group (WON)</div><div><strong>Silicon Valley Turkey Trot 5K</strong> - 16:14 &amp; 13th place out of 12,746 runners &amp; 2nd place in age group (2nd Best 5K Ever)</div><div><strong>Hot Chocolate 15K</strong> - 56:46 &amp; 13th place out of 3,334 runners &amp; 2nd place in age group (Lifetime PR)</div><div><strong>Arizona Heroes In Recovery 6K</strong> (Changed to 4 Mile Race) - 22:40 &amp; 10th out of 427 runners &amp; 5th place in age group (Lifetime PR)</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2017 Top Post Collegiate Runs:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>5K (3.10 Mi.) @ 5:13 Pace - 16:14 Total Time&nbsp;</div><div>15K (9.32 Mi.) @ 6:06 Pace - 56:36 Total Time</div><div>Distance Run - 6.36 Mi. @ 6:25 Pace - 40:54 Total Time</div><div>Distance Run - 6.31 Mi. @ 6:39 Pace - 41:53 Total Time</div><div>Distance Run - 6.32 Mi. @ 6:20 Pace - 40:02 Total Time</div><div>Distance Run - 7.01 Mi. @ 6:20 Pace - 44:25 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 9.10 Mi. @ 6:36 Pace - 1:00:06 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 9.39 Mi. @ 6:32 Pace - 1:01:23 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 10.80 Mi. @ 6:29 Pace - 1:10:04 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 13.10 Mi. @ 6:11 Pace - 1:21:11 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 13.25 Mi. @ 8:29 Pace - 1:52:58 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 14.01 Mi. @ 6:53 Pace - 1:36:52 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 18.03 Mi. @ 6:25 Pace - 1:55:58 Total Time</div><div><br></div><div>My main goal of the last 6 months of post collegiate running and training has been to stay in shape, continue doing what I love, and finding new runs and races to be a part of. I decided to begin training to race in my first official half marathon AND my first marathon in early 2018. I am very happy with how the 5 races that I ran in this season were great training runs for the Half and full Marathon races. I am so excited to run in my first official Half Marathon at the Rock N Roll Half Marathon in Tempe, Arizona on January 14th in just over 2 weeks, followed by the Phoenix-Mesa Marathon on February 24th! I am looking forward to running a lot more in 2018 and seeing where the rest of my competitive distance running career will go.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>2018 Running</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">After about halfway through 2018, I am thankful to say that I have been able to crush some running goals of mine, some of which I never thought I would accomplish. I spent the first few months of 2018 in Marathon Training, training for the 2018 Phoenix Marathon. One of my huge goals was to run sub 3:05:00 and qualify for the 2019 Boston Marathon which I accomplished.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">After Marathon Training, I spent most of my free time coaching as an Assistant Track &amp; Field Coach for a Middle School &amp; High School Track &amp; Field team in Arizona and occasionally doing individual Track workouts that I create/design. I ran a 3K Lifetime PR at the Redlands Invitational at my alma mater, the University of Redlands in March, then took a break from track and spent most of March-May transitioning to shorter mileage, running casually, and coaching a few individual runners as clients. I believe it is important to take braks after hard races and long seasons of training. I have been running regularly since July 2017 including Marathon Training followed by some hard workouts, so I am now taking a few weeks off from hard running. I plan to start training hard again toward the end of the summer or in early fall form my nect big goal: the 2019 Boston Marathon. Stay tuned for more....</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Here are my races and PRs from 2018:</span></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong><em>Rock N Roll Half Marathon</em></strong> - 1:15:49 &amp; 3rd Place In Age Group, 18th out of 8,573 Runners (Lifetime PR)</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong><em>Phoenix Marathon</em></strong> - 2:45:57 &amp; 1st Place In &amp; WON Age Group, 21st Place Overall out of 2,226 Runners (Lifetime PR) AND Qualified for the 2019 New York City Marathon, 2019 Boston Marathon, 2019 Chicago Marathon, &amp; 2019 London Marathon</span></div><div><strong><em>Redlands Invitational 3K</em></strong> - 9:30.1 &amp; 6th Place out of 18 Runners (Lifetime PR)</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>

                <div><strong>MARATHON TRAINING&nbsp;</strong></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>If you are a novice or beginner runner and especially if you have never ran a full Marathon before, I definitely recommend sticking to a training program that is easy to follow and does not&nbsp;</div><div>require you to completely transform your life to make time for runs and workouts. Lots of beginner or first time Marathoners follow programs with 2-3 rest days or easy days each week. If your goal is to run a Marathon just to finish it, there are many beginner Marathon Training books and online training programs that you can follow. Here are a few books and websites that I recommend to help with Marathon Training for runners &amp; marathoners of any tenure or level:</div><div><br></div><div><em>Hal Higdon's Training Program (16 Week Trainng Program)</em></div><div><em>Nike Running Marathon Training Program</em></div><div><em>Boston Marathon Training Program</em></div><div><em>TCS New York City Training Program</em></div><div><em>Running My First Marathon</em></div><div><em>Run Fast, Eat Slow</em></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>2017-2018 Distance &amp; Marathon Training</strong></div><div><strong><em>Best Distance Runs</em></strong></div><div>*I consider Distance Runs to be any run under 6:45 Mile Pace. My Distance Pace was around 6:40-6:55 at the end of college and before I began my 2017-2018 Marathon Training. MY Distance Pace dropped down to around 6:20-6:40 at the end of my 2017-2018 Distance &amp; Marathon Training season.</div><div><br></div><div>Distance Run - 6.36 Mi. @ 6:25 Pace - 40:54 Total Time</div><div>Distance Run - 6.31 Mi. @ 6:39 Pace - 41:53 Total Time</div><div>Distance Run - 6.32 Mi. @ 6:20 Pace - 40:02 Total Time</div><div>Distance Run - 7.01 Mi. @ 6:20 Pace - 44:25 Total Time</div><div>Distance Run - 6.21 Mi. @ 6:06 Pace - 36:32 Total Time</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2017-2018 Distance &amp; Marathon Training</strong></div><div><strong><em>Best Tempo Runs</em></strong></div><div>*I consider Tempo Runs to be any runs faster than my Distance Pace. I also ran Tempo Runs and did a few Long Tempo Runs. At the end of Marathon Training, my Tempo Pace was around my Half Marathon Race Pace at 5:45-5:55 Mile Pace for shorter Tempo Runs and 6:05-6:20 for Long Tempo Runs.</div><div><br></div><div>Tempo Run - 6.25 Mi. @ 6:06 Pace - 36:02 Total Time</div><div>Long Tempo Run - 8.32 Mi. @ 6:15 Pace - 54:01 Total Time</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2017-2018 Distance &amp; Marathon Training</strong></div><div><strong><em>Best Long Runs</em></strong></div><div>*I consider my Long Runs to be any run over 9.00 Miles. I usually alternate Long Easy Runs with Long Hard Runs every other weekend during training. Most of my Long Runs were at my Marathon Goal Pace (6:45 when I began training). </div><div><br></div><div>Long Run - 9.10 Mi. @ 6:36 Pace - 1:00:06 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 9.39 Mi. @ 6:32 Pace - 1:01:23 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 10.80 Mi. @ 6:29 Pace - 1:10:04 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 13.10 Mi. @ 6:11 Pace - 1:21:11 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 13.11 Mi. @ 6:39 Pace - 1:27:12 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 13.25 Mi. @ 8:25 Pace - 1:41:02 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 13.25 Mi. @ 8:31 Pace - 1:53:01 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 14.01 Mi. @ 6:53 Pace - 1:36:52 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 18.03 Mi. @ 6:25 Pace - 1:55:58 Total Time</div><div>Long Run - 20.01 Mi. @ 6:24 Pace - 2:08:15 Total Time</div><div><br></div><div>For my peak Marathon Training mileage about 3 months out from my Marathon race date, I ran all of my Long Hard Runs in my Nike Zoon Vaporfly 4% Marathon Racing Shoes. For Long Runs that I ran over a Half Marathon distance (13.10 Miles), I ran in the same shoes and in my race outfit to simulate what my body would feel like during racing.</div><div>My Long Run, Half Marathon, and Marathon race outfit included Black Adidas or Road Runner Sports spandex, one of myAdidas Adidazero racing singlets, CG ankle running socks, my Red Nike Zoom Vaporfly 4% shoes, and my TomTom Spark 3 GPS Running watch.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>2017-2018 Distance &amp; Marathon Training</strong></div><div><strong><em>Races</em></strong></div><div>*I registered for 7 races for my 2017-2018 Distance &amp; Marathon Training Season in August of 2017 when I began thinking about my goal to run a Marathon. I chose to run the 2018 Phoenix Marathon as my first Marathon because of a few reasons. When planning to run a Marathon (especially if it's your first career Marathon), I recommend taking a few things into consideration; weather, course, race atmosphere, expense, and training.</div><div>I chose to run in the Phoenix Marathon in February 2018, because the race was taking place in Arizona which is extremely hot for most of the spring and summer and is often over 100 degrees (in my opionion from April through October). I wanted my peak Marathon training mileage to be about 4 weeks or 1 month before the Marathon, and I wanted to run my first Half Marathon about 6-8 weeks before my Marathon to give myself enough rest and recovery time between my Half Marathon and full Marathon. I knew that the bulk of my training and racing would be December 2017-February 2018, so I wanted to find races in Arizona that were during the same timeframe to fit with the weather and my training which is why I ran the Half and full Marathon that I ran.</div><div>One of my large goals was to qualify for the 2019 Boston Marathon, which meant that I had to run in a B.A.A. Certified Marathon and beat my time qualification for my age and gender. My time qualification for my gender and age group of Male 18-35 was 3:05:00. My goal was to break 3 hours and run under 2:59:59. The Phoenix Marathon is a B.A.A. certified course, is considered a Boston Qualifying Marathon, and is known as a fast Marathon course usually with great weather.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Global Energy Run 5K</strong></div><div><em>September 24th, 2017 - Tempe, Arizona</em><br>17:48 &amp; 2nd place overall out of 458 runners &amp; 2nd place in age group</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Veterans Day Run 5K</strong></div><div><em>November 11th, 2017 - Tempe, Arizona</em><br>17:21 &amp; 1st place overall out of 327 runners &amp; 1st place in age group (WON)</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Silicon Valley Turkey Trot 5K</strong></div><div><em>November 23rd, 2017 - San Jose, California</em></div><div>16:14 &amp; 13th place out of 12,746 runners &amp; 2nd place in age group (2nd Best 5K Ever)</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Hot Chocolate 15K</strong></div><div><em>December 3rd, 2017 - Scottsdale, Arizona</em><br>56:46 &amp; 13th place out of 3,334 runners &amp; 2nd place in age group (2nd 15K Ever &amp; Lifetime PR)</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Arizona Heroes In Recovery 6K</strong> (Changed to 4 Mile Race) </div><div><em>December 17th, 2017 - Gilbert, Arizona</em></div><div>22:40 &amp; 10th out of 427 runners &amp; 5th place in age group (Lifetime PR)</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Rock N Roll Half Marathon</strong></div><div><em>January 14th, 2018 - Tempe, Arizona</em><br>1:15:49 &amp; 3rd Place In Age Group, 18th out of 8,573 Runners (Lifetime PR)</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Phoenix Marathon</strong></div><div><em>February 24th, 2018 - Mesa, Arizona</em><br>2:45:57 &amp; 1st Place In &amp; WON Age Group, 21st Place Overall out of 2,226 Runners (Lifetime PR) AND Qualified for the 2019 New York City Marathon, 2019 Boston Marathon, 2019 Chicago Marathon, &amp; 2019 London Marathon!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>

This training program is not approved by any certified running coaches, sports doctors, or running groups. This training progam is solely recomendations based on what has worked for me and what I have used to coach other Distance and Marathon runners.</div><div><br></div><div>For most of my 2017-2018 Marathon Training, I followed a 3 Phase Marathon program. These 3 phases were developed and created based off of how I believe my body reacts to running, mileage, training, workouts, and races. The goal of these 3 phases were to transition my body to be able to run higher mileage and to peak with my best performances during big Long Run and Race goals.</div><div><br></div><div>I do believe this 3 phase training program worked well for me but WAS NOT PERFECT. I do not believe there is one single perfect workout or training plan for any runner; I believe that it takes time and practice to be able to understand what each athlete or runner's body reacts to.</div><div><br></div><div>3 Phase Marathon Training Program</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></h3>
